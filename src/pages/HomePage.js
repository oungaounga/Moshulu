                I started learning React through making small projects and
                studying the language, a close friend of mine told me about the
                university association he's started, aiming to provide students
                a place where they can link with each other and with local
                students. It was obvious that it implied a website at some
                point. It was the perfect opportunity for me to begin a bigger
                project, useful for others in real life.

                I wanted to provide a platform containing the main part of the
                Association's digital face, giving the user an easier access to
                services, for the organization to manage quickly. My friend,
                besides all the association's free services, wanted to be able
                to sell events and products, and also an access to a users
                database. It is still in the realm of simple websites.

                React, like for this web page, is the framework used. The theme
                would be important, I discovered this UI library, NextUI, based
                on Vercel's works. Boiler Room organizes club events throughout
                the world, I like their website's clean and simple layout, which
                is still a popular one.

                From experience and what we have seen, the student's rarely use
                their phones to plan their personal life, especially plans to go
                out, join friends or visit places. Responsiveness, and the phone
                layout were very important, which I was happy about, deep in my
                mind thinking about pushing the project forward and create an
                app (React Native ðŸ‘€)

              <p className="pl-[0.7rem]">
                I will be speaking from a user's perspective. Traveling implied
                booking flights and transports. Traveling to the UK might imply
                the use of apps that are a good source of headache to me, and a
                day before I began working on this website, I went to the UK. On
                Ryan Air's app to book a flight, from selecting the flight to
                the payment part, I have to go each time by extra steps that are
                not necessary; car rental, insurance, hotel booking, taxis.
                However, these steps are good for Ryan Air's economics. I
                concluded with "Some processes must take the tangent and make
                the steps as few as possible". If a user needs to buy access to
                an event ? He does, no additional steps. He wants to buy some
                product ? He does, no "add to cart" implied. He needs a cart ?
                He gets one and can buy many things at once. Directly, making
                the extra steps as options, not a necessity.

                  An app that I have to use much more. National express charges
                  1Â£ per booking, or at least used to. So let's see what I am
                  paying for.

                      Booking summary tab pops up, can't go down and takes half
                      of my screen.

                    <li>
                      Don't want to reserve my seat, still sending me to the

                    <li>Same as Ryan Air, too much extra steps.</li>
                    <li>
                      Through all the steps, I am confused about what is
                      happening.

                No chit chat, the event page needs to be "straight to the
                point", still providing the necessary information to the user. A
                user's needs to know what's the event about, when and where,
                who's coming. The project is still work in progress phase, looks
                like the following :

                For now, the homepage is quite simple, reckon will get rid of

                on the homepage. There will be a page containing all events and
                products. Another for all the relevant media.
